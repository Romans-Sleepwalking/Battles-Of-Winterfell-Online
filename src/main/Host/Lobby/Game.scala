  /*
  The Game class represents the game process itself - the brain which calls, listens, process, calls...
  A game begins when the Game class is called - when 2 PLAYERS are connected to the same room.
  A game is a recursion of characters' turns.

  By every character's turn, the Game must:
    1) inform both players about the beginning of the turn.
    2) send to active player his action options.
    3) process the received action choice.
    4) inform both players about the action consequences.
    5) call a next turn.

  The Game class contains:
    路)  A map of characters to their assigned IDs
    路)  A cycle of characters by assigning them graph-node relations
    路)  startTurn method which performs actions 1), 2)
    路)  endTurn method which performs actions 3), 4), 5)
